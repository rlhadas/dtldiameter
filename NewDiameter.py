# Diameter.py
# Written by Eli Zupke and Andrew Ramirez June 2017
# It is based off of Jordan Haack's work on a polynomial-time algorithm for the DTL MPR Diameter Problem

# 0. ON THE PAPER
#
#       This program is based off of an algorithm written by Jordan Haack. There is a paper that describes this
#   algorithm more thoroughly than can be expressed in source code comments. The paper title is "Computing the Diameter
#   of the Space of Maximum Parsimony Reconciliations in the Duplication-Transfer-Loss Model". #TODO add more info
#
#       Note that in this documentation and in that paper, there is a notion of the "group" of a gene node that contains
#   every mapping and event node relating to that gene. While this is a useful abstraction to think about the problem,
#   it doesn't seem to be required in the code. So when the documentation of this program refers to the "group" of a
#   node, sometimes notated as Group(u), be aware that it does not directly correspond to any data structure in the
#   program.

# 1. ON TREE REPRESENTATION FORMATS:
#
#       This file deals with trees in two formats: Edge-based formats, and vertex-based formats. The edged-based
#   trees are what are output from DTLReconGraph.py (which returns them straight from newickFormatReader), and are what this
#   file uses to represent the species tree. For readability and convenience purposes, the gene tree is converted to
#   a vertex tree in the reformat_tree() method.
#
#   Both trees use dictionaries to store the tree structure, but formats differ slightly.
# Example:
#   When N is a node descended from R, with children C1 and C2,
#
#   An entry in the edge-based representation looks like this:
#       {('R','N'): ('R','N', ('N','C1'), ('N','C2')) ...}
#
#   And an entry in the vertex-based representation looks like this:
#       {'N':('C1','C2') ...}
#
#   Because the standard elsewhere in this codebase is to use edge-based trees, all vertex-based tree variable names
#   will explicitly contain the word "vertex", while edge-based trees will not. So, an edge-based tree can be named
#   "tree" while a vertex-based tree has to be named "vertex_tree".

# 2. ON THE NAMING CONVENTION OF THE TWO TREES:
#
#       This file calls the two trees the gene tree and the species tree. Other programs, like DTLReconGraph.py, have different
#   naming conventions (such as "host" for the species tree and "parasite" for the gene tree) because they were coded
#   under different assumptions as to what the two trees represent. Let it be understood that these names are
#   synonymous, and that references to "hTop" or "pTop" refer to the name of the handle of the species and
#   gene trees that DTLReconGraph outputs.


# 3. ON THE USAGE OF PATHS AND THE PATH REPRESENTATION FORMAT:
#
#       compute_enter_mapping_table() needs to use the symmetric set difference between every pair of paths on the gene
#   tree. This is pre-computed in build_path_symmetric_set_difference_table() and stored in a nested dictionary.
#   The format of each path is a tuple where the first entry is the species node that the path starts on, and the second
#   entry is the species node that the path ends on. These paths are stored as the keys of a dictionary called
#   path_edges.

# 4. ON THE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING TABLES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS:
#
#       The Diameter algorithm involves the use of three dynamic programming tables:
#   The enter_mapping_table, the exit_mapping_table, and the exit_event_table. All three of these have the same key
#   format: [u][x][y], where u is a node on the gene tree, and x and y are either event nodes or mapping nodes. Which
#   type each table has is evident in the name.
#
#       These tables are computed for every gene node, in post-order. Functions that begin with the word 'computed'
#   build these tables by taking them in as a reference and modifying the values. These functions return nothing.
#   Other functions (such as one starting with 'build') actually return the thing that they are creating.
#
#       The tables are described in detail in the paper, but a summary of their functions follows:
#
#       exit_event_table (only implied in the paper) contains the largest number of event nodes that each pair of
#   reconciliations rooted at events x and y can differ for, where x and y are exit-event nodes in Group(u).
#       exit_mapping_table (called EXIT in the paper) contains the largest number of event nodes that each pair of
#   reconciliation subtrees rooted at mapping nodes x and y can differ for, on the condition that x and y go
#   immediately to an exit-event.
#       enter_mapping_table (called ENTER in the paper) contains the largest number of event nodes that each pair
#   of reconciliation subtrees rooted at x and y can differ for when x and y are used to enter Group(u).
#
#       To get a better sense of how the tables are structured, you can try running an example in debug mode, which
#   will actually print out these tables.

# 5. ON EXIT_X_BY_Y DICTIONARIES:
#
#       There are several helper dictionaries which pertain to exit events. Their names should be pretty self
#   explanatory, but they are described more fully here.
#
#       exit_events_by_mapping is keyed by mapping node. Each entry contains a list of every exit event
#   that is a child of that mapping node
#       exit_events_by_gene is keyed by gene node. Each entry contains a list of every exit event in
#   the group of that gene node
#       exit_mappings_by_gene is keyed by gene node. Each entry contains a list of every mapping node
#   in group of that gene node, on the condition that that mapping node has an exit event

# -1. DATA STRUCTURE QUICK REFERENCE:
