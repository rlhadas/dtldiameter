# DTLReconGraph.py  --  was previously named DP.py
# Ran Libeskind-Hadas, June 2015
# The basic DP algorithm for reconciling pairs of trees

# Altered and expanded by Carter Slocum and Annalise Schweickart
# Altered and expanded by Andrew Ramirez and Eli Zupke

# A tree is represented as a dictionary of key-value pairs where a key is an
# edge name and the value is a tuple of the form
# (start vertex, end vertex, left child edge name, right child edge name)
# An edge name may be None.  The "dummy" edge leading to the root of the
# parasite tree, denoted e^P in the technical report, must be named "pTop".
# The final DTL reconciliation graph is represented as a dictionary, with
# keys representing mapping nodes, and the associated values corresponding
# to events that can occur at each mapping node in an MPR, as well as other small
# values/information (see docstring of DP for more info on these values).

# Edited by Annalise Schweickart and Carter Slocum, July 2015 to return
# the DTL reconciliation graph that uses frequency scoring, as well as the
# number of reconciliations of the host and parasite trees.

# Edited by Andrew Ramirez and Eli Zupke in late June 2017 to return the number of MPRs for a given data set
# with an improved time efficiency relative to previous methods, usually by a factor of greater than or
# equal to 2.
